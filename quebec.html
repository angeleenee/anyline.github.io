                                    <p>Adventures in Quebec city</p>
                                    <img src="images/quebec2.jpg" />
                                    <p>This Easter weekend, I had the pleasure of going on a trip to Quebec city with my dad.
                                    Perhaps one of the highlights was spending time and practicing our French together, since we always converse in English.</p>
                                    <img src="images/quebec6.jpg" />
                                    <p>One of the first places we visited was the Musée national des Beaux-Arts. We saw the exhibitions, a creative one about
                                    illusions, and the galleries with art from QUebec throughout the centuries. A most notable thing for me was the magnitude of
                                    sculptures made by Iroquois people. They were different, and reflected their culture. </p>
                                    <img src="images/quebec1.jpg" />
                                    Afterwards, we visited the charming Plaines d'Abraham and Old Quebec. It has a vibe that is distinct to that area. It always
                                    reminds me of the heart-warming K-drama Goblin when we walk there.

                                    Finally, we also got some ramen at Tori-ya. It was my second time having ramen in my lifetime, and the first time I went to such
                                    and authentic Japanese restaurant- it was packed! We were greeted with the Japanese expression for when you enter a restaurant, 
                                    something I had never experienced before. It was a fun street with many cool restaurants, I'd definitely like to go again.

                                would bring about everywhere, but digital! It isn't limited to any topics, nor is it limited in pages. You can find my thoughts on various books,
                                follow my journey in learning Korean, random daily observations, and more! My computer's storage is the limit!

                                Oh, you're curious about me? I'm flattered. Well, I'm just a high school student who has no idea what she's doing, holding a blog because, well having a blog always
                                sounded like a fun idea. Join me on my journey to.. knowing more? About the world, about myself? To acquiring more skills? To understanding what I find important? To having a better blog? Yes, I think the latter's the one.
