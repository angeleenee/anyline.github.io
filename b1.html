      <h2>WHAT IS THIS BLOG?</h2>
      So this is my first blog post. For my own sake, I thought I would decide what exactly my goals were with this blog.
      <img src="https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/what-is-a-blog.jpg">
      This is what I got for its definition. So basically, I just write about whatever I want, consistently. <br>
      Now, many sources advised that a blogger should choose a niche, narrow down their interests to a specific audience. I chose this one >
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/NASA-HS201427a-HubbleUltraDeepField2014-20140603.jpg/1200px-NASA-HS201427a-HubbleUltraDeepField2014-20140603.jpg">
      Okay, okay, I'll be serious.  What topics shall I write about? Well, I like books, science, language-learning, writing, rabbits..  How about I just dub this a personal blog and call it a day. Personal blog = blog about anything that personally affects me.

      So what could a cherished reader like you expect to find here? Put in better words, WHAT IS THIS BLOG? We'll see. For now, I've got my 'diaries' section, peeks of my life. I'm also planning on talking about books. Maybe I'll mention learning Korean. I want to post photos of my rabbit, because my personal opinion is that joy should be shared in the world. Yeah, I'll be writing pretty sponataneously.
      <br>
      Finally, the blog-creating gurus (the internet)  revealed that an excellent blog required a title. (Who would've guessed?) Jokes on them, I already chose one! Any Line was obviously the superior choice because this website has no direction. I guess it technically does, I am following the direction of the pen.It also ressembles my name, Angeline.
