                                        An enthralling book exploring the author's diasporic family history
                                        Even though it had a generally placid autobiographical tone, this novel was never predictable. I couldn't stop reading.
                                        I don't think I'm the only person who finds ancestral history fascinating, especially in a culture that is your own. In this case, the author
                                        was recounting stories from his exiled Korean family, who traveled to Japan and Canada. Additionally, the French writing was so poetic. The author
                                        explores the relation of Korea and poetry/literature, of it perhaps being a way for it to maintain its identity after undergoing so much separation.

                                Welcome to my blog, a library of whatever I feel like writing about. Think of it as a field journal, or a sketchbook an artist
                                would bring about everywhere, but digital! It isn't limited to any topics, nor is it limited in pages. You can find my thoughts on various books,
                                follow my journey in learning Korean, random daily observations, and more! My computer's storage is the limit!

                                Oh, you're curious about me? I'm flattered. Well, I'm just a high school student who has no idea what she's doing, holding a blog because, well having a blog always
                                sounded like a fun idea. Join me on my journey to.. knowing more? About the world, about myself? To acquiring more skills? To understanding what I find important? To having a better blog? Yes, I think the latter's the one.
